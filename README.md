# NoteConversors
This programs take part in the development of my final university project. I have made this program to check the viability of the Wavetable sintesis to generate sound. This method uses a linear interpolation formula between sound samples. This program applies Waveteble sintesis to the sound samples of a .wav file, consequently generates another .wav file with the result of use the before mentioned formula.
