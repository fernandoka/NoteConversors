# NoteConversors
This programs take part in the development of my final university project. I have made this program to check the viability of the Wavetable sintesis to generate sound. This method uses a linear interpolation formula between sound samples. This program applies Waveteble sintesis to the sound samples of a .wav file, consequently generates another .wav file with the result of use the before mentioned formula. 
This project is provided with two shell script, one of them generates all the notes of a upright piano (88 notes)
