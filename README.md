# NoteConversors
This programs take part in the development of my final university project. I have made this program to check the viability of the Wavetable sintesis to generate sound. This method uses a linear interpolation formula between sound samples. This program applies Waveteble sintesis to the sound samples of a .wav file, consequently generates another .wav file with the result of use the before mentioned formula. 

How to use:


This project is provided with two shell scripts, one of them generates all the 88 notes of a piano (generateNotes.sh) which are saved as .wav file in differents folders. All these generated files could be easily removed using the other shell script (cleanNotes.sh). 
The folders Fur_Elise and Twinkle Twinkle_Twinkle_Little_Star contains the corresponding notes to play the firsts notes for each song.
